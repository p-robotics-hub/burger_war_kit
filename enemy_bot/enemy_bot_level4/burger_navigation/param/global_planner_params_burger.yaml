GlobalPlanner:
    allow_unknown: true
    #Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space. NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert all your unknown space to free space (which planner will then happily go right through.
    
    default_tolerance : 0.0
    #A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. The planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.
    
    visualize_potential: false
    #Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed via a PointCloud2.
    
    use_dijkstra: true
    #If true, use dijkstra's algorithm. Otherwise, A*.
    
    use_quadratic: true
    #If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation.
    
    use_grid_path: false
    #If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method.
    
    old_navfn_behavior: false
    #If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters
